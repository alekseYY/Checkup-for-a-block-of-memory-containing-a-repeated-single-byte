# Checkup-for-a-block-of-memory-containing-a-repeated-single-byte

This mini-project was inspired by discussion about my posting to the StackExchange CodeReview site:

https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/288688/checkup-for-a-block-of-memory-containing-a-repeated-single-byte

Many thanks to G.Sliepen for his valuable suggestions how to imnprove my code - all of them have been implemented and saved in this repository. It's good to know that the 'void*' pointer can statically casted!
